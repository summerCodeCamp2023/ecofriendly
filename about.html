             <p>1.<b>>Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emission:</b>By shifting to alternative technologies that either don't need gasoline (like bicycles and electric cars ) or don't need much(like hybrid cars)</p>
             <P>2.<b>>Reduse food loss and waste and shift to more sustainable diets:</b>There are a few different ways that climate change and hunger go hand-in-hand .whether it's kale or kobe beef,producing food accounts for some measure of greenhouse gasses .In 2021,the food and agriculture organization estimated we consumed more meat than ever before.By 2050 this will,by some estimates,increse greenhouse gas emissions from food production by 60%.Likewise,many farmers use nitrous-based fertilizers to grow more crops,more quickly to meet demand.</P>
             <p> 3.<b>Halt deforestation and commit to rebuliding damaged ecosystems:</b> The rapid deforestation of the earth,especially over the last 60 years,has contributed to climate change,creating "heat islands" out of land that will normally be protected by trees and other flora from overheating.Simply put,this has to stop.There are actions each of us can take as individuals to help halt this-going paperlessand buying recycled paper products,planting trees or supporting organizations that do this (like concern),and recycling</p>
             <p> 4.<b>Sea and Ocean Preservation:</b>Oceans and seas are the largest storage of greenhouse gases and are an exceptional support system for life on this planet.Limiting overfishing, unsustainable development activities in coastal ares and the consumption of environmentally friendly products is now essential</p>
             <p> 5.<b> Reduce Plastic:</b>plastic is made from oil,and the process of extracting,refining and turning oil into plastic (or even polyester,for clothing) is surprisingly carbon-intense.It doesn't break down quickly in nature so a lot of plastic is burned, which contributes to emissions .Demand for plastic is rising so quickly that creating and disposing of plastic will account for 17% of the global carbon budget by 2050(this is the emissions count you need to stay within according to the paris agreement).</p>
